Right now, I haven't quite got the unity packages able to be exported, but you can clone and use the prefabs.

If you use this ballpit, I would appreciate a call out, but all code that is mine is under the MIT/x11 license.

Credits:

## General Dependencies 

 * Udon Sharp
 * Brokered Sync (And you MUST have a brokered sync manager in your heirarchy)
 * AudioLink (not needed in operation but must be included in project)
 * (Soft) Texel's Video Player

## (How to open)

Process:
 * Open Project, BUT NOT SCENE.

Import the following, in order:
 * World SDK

Re-Open Unity.
 * Udon Sharp
 * CyanEmu
 
Extra:
 * VRWorldToolkit (V1.11.2 current)
 * You may need to

Run the Udon refresh scripts operation.

Reopen Unity
 * Open Scene


## TODO
 * Figure out why shadow edge length too short.
 * Add shadows to the balls.
 * Make ball pit use SDF for boundary.
 * Make both cameras for combine pass be at the same position, only one piece of geometry, maybe?
 * Test out explicit CRT Rendering Orders https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-CustomRenderTexture.html#custom-render-texture
 * Double up physics steps, and make them sensitive to time.
 * Cleanup shaders, leaving standard ones.
 * Re: CRT Testing: Try assigning material and updating, and cycling in one fell swoop.
 * Figure out why some users get inundated by warnings about adding a depth buffer.
 * Make textured ball effect.
 * Figure out ball nonshadows occasionally.
 * Option to draw video on side of balls.
 * Why is AudioLink weird when doing colors.
 * Fix fadeout not writing fadeout tile to depth in depth pass.

```glsl
 
for( j = 0; j < 4; j++ )
{
	uint obid;
	if( j == 0 )      obid = _Adjacency0[hashed];
	else if( j == 0 ) obid = _Adjacency1[hashed];
	else if( j == 0 ) obid = _Adjacency2[hashed];

VR Computer RTX 2070, Ryzen 3900X; Index at 144 Hz, 122%. Numbers are minimum times, peak up to about .3ms higher... So, signal in data is pretty good, probably around +/- .2ms. 

Conclusion when doing camera shimshammery: ~~Put cameras and objects on `PickupNoEnvironment`.  Cull for all objects not on `PickupNoEnvironment`~~ Your layers don't matter. 

Numbers with quick menu closed / open / With AudioLink and basic video player
Same layers, PickupNoEnvironment: 7.6ms / 9.3ms
Camera on default, looking at PickupNoEnvironment: 8.2ms / 10.0ms
Camera on UiMenu, looking at UiMenu: 8.1ms / 10.1ms
Camera on default, looking at UiMenu: 8.1 / 10.1 ms
(repeat) Camera on PickupNoEnvironment, looking at PickupNoEnvironment: 7.6ms / 9.4ms
Control: Everything off:  7ms / 7ms (framecap) (1.6ms / 2.5ms)
Control: Only AudioLink: 7ms / 7ms (framecap) (1.8ms / 2.7ms)
(repeat) Camera on PickupNoEnvironment, looking at PickupNoEnvironment: 8.1ms / 9.4ms
Camera on UiMenu, looking at UiMenu: 7.6ms / 9.3ms


## Control Update Test
 * Running uncapped, baseline 5.505ms / 4.17MB
 * Adding 500 tiles, each has VRCObjectSync, A custom script to handle disabling interaction on moving and VRCPickup.
 * .5ms Udon time / 11.250ms / 4.19MB
 * Removing VRCObjectSync
 * .35ms Udon time / 6.3ms / 4.19MB
 * Deltas: 
 *   With VRCObjectSync:                 .15ms UDON Time / 5.75ms Frame Time
 *   Without VRCObjectSync:               0ms  UDON Time / 0.8ms Frame Time
 *   Switching my object to manual:       0ms  UDON Time / 0.6ms Frame Time
 *   Adding an Update() method with i=0: 1.5ms UDON Time / 2.2ms Frame Time
 *   Using a brokered update function   : .3ms UDON Time /  0.9ms Frame Time
 * BetterObjectSync -> Going back to original scene.
 *   5.261ms.
 * Took exact thing from TEST to Upload version and visit with --fps=0 and in RenderDoc, it was 4.757ms
