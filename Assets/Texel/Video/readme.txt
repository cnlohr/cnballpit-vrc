Video Prefabs (what should I use??)

Sync Player
-----------------------------------
The main video player asset with all the features and lets players enter URLs
to play for everyone in the room.  Use thie when you need a general-purpose
video player.

Basic Sync Player
-----------------------------------
A heavily simplified version of the sync player, only two scripts with no other
dependencies.  This is the same script as the AudioLink Mini Player.  Use this
if you specifically want a minimal player or want to keep a minimum amount
of scripts.

Local Video Player
-----------------------------------
A local-only video player based on the Unity Video Player asset.  Good for
playing youtube but won't play streams.  No UI by default, but can be hooked
into some of the assets that use the data proxy.  Use this when you want
to let players trigger videos on demand not synced to other players, such as
in a gallery.

Local Stream Player
-----------------------------------
A local-only video player based on the AVPro asset.  Can play any video,
particularly good for streams.  No UI by default, but can be hooked into some
of the assets that use the data proxy.  Use this for event worlds when you
plan on streaming a single burned-in URL.  Streams naturally sync on their
own and this asset has no additional network sync that could be a central
point of failure during an event.
